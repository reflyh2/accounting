Accounting Application Codebase Summary

Purpose: This document provides a high-level overview of the accounting application codebase, enabling an AI agent to understand the code's structure, functionality, and context.

Technology Stack:
- Backend: Laravel (PHP framework)
- Frontend:
  - Inertia.js (for server-side rendering and client-side routing)
  - Vue.js (JavaScript framework for user interface)
  - Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework for styling)

Code Structure:
- The codebase follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
- Models represent database entities and business logic.
- Views are Vue.js components that render the user interface.
- Controllers handle user requests and interact with models.
- Inertia.js connects the frontend and backend, enabling server-side rendering and seamless navigation.

Key Features:
- Multi-tenancy: The application supports multiple tenants (companies) using the Stancl tenancy package. Each tenant has its own database and subdomain.
- Authentication and Authorization: User authentication is handled by Laravel Breeze, and role-based authorization is managed using Spatie's laravel-permission package.
- Accounting Modules: The application includes modules for:
  - Chart of Accounts
  - Currencies
  - Journals
  - General Ledger
  - Cash Bank Book
  - Income Statement
  - Balance Sheet
  - Assets
  - Asset Categories
  - Asset Maintenance
  - Asset Financing Payments
  - Asset Rental Payments
  - Suppliers
  - Customers
  - Members
  - Partners
  - Employees

Additional Notes:
- The codebase uses Repomix to package the entire repository into a single XML file for easy consumption by AI agents.
- The frontend uses Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a utility-first approach to design.
- The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices.

How an AI Agent Can Use This Document:
- An AI agent can use this document to understand the overall context of the codebase, including the technology stack, code structure, and key features.
- The agent can then use this knowledge to assist with code generation, review, and analysis tasks.
- For example, if asked to generate code for a new accounting feature, the agent can leverage its understanding of the existing modules and code patterns to produce relevant and accurate code.
